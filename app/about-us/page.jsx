The worst thing that can ever happen for a doctrine is the lack of attractiveness of its adherents based on the natural order that every human being demands innately. We call it the original word order. Once the followers of the philosophy start achieving the attributes and speak of the knowledge and deliver it in the required eloquence that is most naturally and organically speaking to the innate questions of every human being, the philosophy takes over the specie without the requirement of any external influence.",
